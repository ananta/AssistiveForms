## Project Concept

This project is envisioned as a mobile application that leverages CoreML and a native Large Language Model (LLM) to assist disabled persons in filling out research forms. Using voice commands and guidance, the app aims to facilitate the completion of necessary forms, including consent documents, making the process more accessible for individuals with disabilities.

### Proposed Features

- Voice-Guided Form Completion: A native LLM will interpret voice commands and guide users through the form-filling process, ensuring it's both efficient and accessible.
- CoreML Integration: By employing CoreML, the app will perform efficient on-device machine learning, prioritizing user privacy and real-time interactions.
- Consent Form Assistance: The application will assist users in understanding and signing consent forms and other important documents effortlessly.
- Accessibility First Design: The app will be designed with a focus on accessibility, catering to a wide range of disabilities to ensure broad usability.

### Stage of Development

Currently, this project is in the ideation phase. The features and implementations described are conceptual and subject to change as the project evolves.
